#summary game-music-emu has moved to Bitbucket!
#labels Featured

= Introduction =

Michael Pyne, "guest packager" (and since June 2014 the reluctant maintainer) here. Google is getting rid of Google code, so I've moved game-music-emu over to [https://bitbucket.org/mpyne/game-music-emu/ Bitbucket].

I would update the home page but I'm not actually an admin of this site (though, I will ping Blargg to do it in case he's still around).

Despite my own lack of updates to the code, game-music-emu is not dead and will not die as a result of the move.
